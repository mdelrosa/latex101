# LaTeX 101 Workshop - UC Davis GradPathways

**Note (3/11/2022)**: The Eventbrite page is not live yet, but I will post it here once it is available. For now, you can join the Slack channel (\#latex101 on the [UC Davis Slack server](https://ucdavis.slack.com/)) for updates and questions.

## Background

Welcome! This is a guided walkthrough of the major concepts from the online tutorial, [LearnLaTeX](https://www.learnlatex.org/en/), for the graduate community at UC Davis.

Three sessions last ~2 hours each (~1 hour of content, ~1 hour of typesetting). Each session will be interactive with participants writing and typesetting simple LaTeX files. Experience LaTeX users will be available to answer your questions.

You will not need to download any software to participate. We primarily use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to edit and typeset TeX files. 

On Day 3, I will cover how to use common LaTeX templates, including a CV and a Beamer template.
