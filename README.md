# LaTeX 101 Workshop - UC Davis GradPathways

A guided walkthrough of the major concepts from [LearnLaTeX](https://www.learnlatex.org/en/) for the graduate community at UC Davis.

Three sessions last \~1 hour each. Each session should be interactive with participants writing and typesetting simple LaTeX files.

You do not need to download anything to participate in Days 1 or 2. We primarily use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to edit and typeset TeX files. 

On Day 3, I will cover how to generate figures with embedded LaTeX, which requires installing [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), a free piece of software for editing vector graphics which works on Windows, Mac, and Unix systems.
